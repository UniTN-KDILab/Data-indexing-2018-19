- RDF: this folder contains the RDFs for each CSV mapped using Karma Data Integration Tool and using the PEI ontology.
- R2RML: this folder contains the Models extracted using Karma which maps the CSV files and defines some useful URI for some classes.
- JSON: this folder contains the JSON files extracted with Karma for each mapped dataset.
- SCRIPTS: contains the used script in python3 used to extract CSV files for each dataset and the MATLAB script to classify the presence of people in the images.
- ER: contains the used ER model obtained with yED and also saved in png.
